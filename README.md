##
Lee's Korean Martial Arts wants us to create a website that show what services they offer, their location and current schedule, and what values they have.  Additionally, the website should offer users the ability to sign-up for an account in order to view their current curriculum and upload completed documents.  Users should be able to see family members curriculum as well.

## Project Timeline
In this first semester, we focused on building some of the Front-End Pages & Navbar:
- Home Page
- About Page
- FAQ Page
- Programs Page

In Fall 2022, during CSC 191, our timeline looks like this:
- Create Contact/Location Page
- Create Calendar Page using Google Calendar API
- Create Gallery Page
- Create Profile Page

These last few Front-End Pages will likely be created quickly, thus we will quickly turn focus toward implementing a database for users to sign-up, log-in, and eventually view their profiles
- Build Database to store hashed usernames & passwords, in addition to other information
- Work to integrate Database with Front-End Pages
- Create Family Profile Views
- Once User Profiles are implemented and working, we will add functionality for users to upload files

If time permits and if possible, we wish to integrate MyStudio, a membership management service

## Work So Far
Here is a glance at some of the pages we have created so far:

Clone Repository

Install Yarn by running the following:

Then install necessary packages in local repo:
```bash
npm install

Finally, to run the development version, run:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

## Testing
Testing in CSC 191 consisted of us going through each feature that required some sort of user interaction as well as individual unit testing. This ensured that the website was as bug free as possible when given to the client to maintain. The features that we visually tested include the following:
- Sign Up Validation
- Login Validation
- Forgot Password Validation
- Gallery Page
- Student Profile Page
- Admin Profile Page

The unit tests that we conducted would test each component individually to make sure the proper response was given. If the correct response was returned the test would pass. The components that we unit tested for include:
- Profile Component
- Admin Component
- Change Email Component
- Sign Up Component
- Login Component
- Reset Password Component.


## Deployment
