##
Lee's Korean Martial Arts wants us to create a website that show what services they offer, their location and current schedule, and what values they have.  Additionally, the website should offer users the ability to sign-up for an account in order to download assignments and upload completed assignments.

## Project Timeline
In the first semester (Spring 2022), we focused on building some of the Front-End Pages & Navbar:
- Home Page
- About Page
- FAQ Page
- Programs Page

In the second semester (Fall 2022), we finished the following front-end components:
- Create Contact/Location Page
- Create Calendar Page using Google Calendar API
- Create Gallery Page
- Create Profile Page

Then we moved on to focus on back-end implementation for sign-up, log-in, and profiles
- Build Database to store emails & hashed passwords, in addition to other information
- Work to integrate Database with Front-End Pages
- Functionality for users to upload files

## Testing
Testing in CSC 191 consisted of us going through each feature that required some sort of user interaction as well as individual unit testing. This ensured that the website was as bug free as possible when given to the client to maintain. The features that we visually tested include the following:
- Sign Up Validation
- Login Validation
- Forgot Password Validation
- Gallery Page
- Student Profile Page
- Admin Profile Page

The unit tests that we conducted would test each component individually to make sure the proper response was given. If the correct response was returned the test would pass. The components that we unit tested for include:
- Profile Component
- Admin Component
- Change Email Component
- Sign Up Component
- Login Component
- Reset Password Component.


## Deployment
N/A so far.  To begin in CSC 191
